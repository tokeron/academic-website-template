    abstract = {Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I) use a latent representation of a text prompt to guide the image generation process. However, the encoder that produces the text representation is largely unexplored. We propose the diffusion lens, a method for analyzing the text encoder of T2I models by generating images from its intermediate representations. Using the diffusion lens, we perform an extensive analysis of two recent T2I models. We find that the text encoder gradually builds prompt representations across multiple scenarios. Complex scenes describing multiple objects are composed progressively and more slowly than simple scenes;  earlier layers encode the concepts in the prompts without a clear interaction, which emerges only in later layers. Moreover, the retrieval of uncommon concepts requires further computation until a faithful representation of the prompt is achieved. Concepts are built from coarse to fine, with details being added until the very late layers. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the text encoder component in T2I pipelines.},

  abstract={Formulas have been developed to calculate the forces in a molecular system directly, rather than indirectly through the agency of energy. This permits an independent calculation of the slope of the curves of energy vs. position of the nuclei, and may thus increase the accuracy, or decrease the labor involved in the calculation of these curves. The force on a nucleus in an atomic system is shown to be just the classical electrostatic force that would be exerted on this nucleus by other nuclei and by the electrons' charge distribution. Qualitative implications of this are discussed.},
