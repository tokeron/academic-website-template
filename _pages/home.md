### Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my webpage! I’m Michael Toker, a PhD candidate and a passionate researcher in the field of natural language processing. On this webpage, you can find out more about me, my work, and my interests. I’m fascinated by how language models encode information and how we can make them more explainable and robust. If you share my curiosity and enthusiasm, I invite you to read on and explore my projects. You can also reach out to me anytime if you have any questions or comments. Thank you for visiting and enjoy!

### About me

Hi, I’m Michael Toker, a PhD candidate at the CS faculty of the Technion. I work under the supervision of Prof. Yonatan Belinkov in the NLP research group. My main focus is on explainability and robustness of language models. I want to understand how language models encode information and how we can make them more reliable and trustworthy. I am a huge believer in visualizations.

<!-- In my last work, titled “Diffusion Lens”, I developed a method to generate images from intermediate representations of the language model. Using this method, I found that the text encoder gradually builds prompt representations across multiple scenarios. This work is part of a series of projects that aim to shed light on the inner workings of language models. You can find my publications, code, and images on this webpage. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments. -->
