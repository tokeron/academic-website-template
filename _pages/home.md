### About me

Hi, I’m Michael Toker, a PhD candidate at the Technion's CS faculty. I work in the NLP research group under Prof. Yonatan Belinkov. My research focuses on the explainability and robustness of language models. I aim to understand how these models encode information and how to make them more reliable and trustworthy. I'm a strong advocate for visualizations.

<!-- In my last work, titled “Diffusion Lens”, I developed a method to generate images from intermediate representations of the language model. Using this method, I found that the text encoder gradually builds prompt representations across multiple scenarios. This work is part of a series of projects that aim to shed light on the inner workings of language models. You can find my publications, code, and images on this webpage. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments. -->
